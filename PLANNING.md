# ConsulTracker Project Planning

## Project Overview
ConsulTracker is a comprehensive consulting time tracking and invoicing application designed to help consultants manage their clients, engagements, time logs, and invoicing in one place.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Next-Auth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### Directory Structure
```

└── tests/               # Test files
```

### Database Design
- Tables are defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Implements proper relationships between entities
- Includes audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

### Component Architecture
- Follows atomic design principles
- Components are organized by feature
- Shared components in `app/components`
- Each component has its own directory with:
  - Component file
  - Types file (if needed)
  - Test file
  - CSS module (if needed)

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit type definitions
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces for object types
- Use enums for fixed sets of values

### Component Guidelines
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interface defined for each component
- Proper error handling
- Loading states handled
- Responsive design

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for critical flows
- E2E tests for main user journeys
- Test coverage > 80%

### State Management
- React Context for global state
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Server state with React Query

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/Authorization

## Security Considerations
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Input sanitization
- Secure session management
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

## Performance Optimization
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Caching strategy
- Database indexing
- API response optimization

## Deployment Strategy
- Vercel for hosting
- PostgreSQL on managed service
- CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing
- Staging environment

## Future Considerations
- Multi-tenant support
- Export/Import functionality
- Mobile app
- Integration with accounting software
- Advanced reporting
- Time tracking automation
